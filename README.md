This repository contains the full data collection and processing pipeline used to build the **LOL Dataset**, a structured dataset of Challenger-tier ranked matches from the EUW server. The data is collected directly from the **Riot Games API**, transformed into player, team, and timeline-level views, and prepared for analytics and machine learning tasks such as predicting major in-game events (Baron, Dragon, teamfights, etc.).
